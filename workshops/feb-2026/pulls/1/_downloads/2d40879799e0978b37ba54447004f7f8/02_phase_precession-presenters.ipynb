    "The data set we'll be looking at is from the manuscript [Diversity in neural firing dynamics supports both rigid and learned hippocampal sequences](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad1935). In this study, the authors collected electrophisiology data in rats across multiple sites in layer CA1 of hippocampus to extract the LFP alongside spiking activity of many simultaneous pyramidal units. In each recording session, data were collected while the rats explored a novel environment (a linear or circular track), as well as during sleep before and after exploration. In our following analyses, we'll focus on the exploration period of a single rat and recording session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full dataset for this study can be accessed on [DANDI](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000044/0.210812.1516). Since the file size of a recording session can be large from the LFP saved for each recorded channel, we'll use a smaller file that contains the spiking activity and the LFP from a single, representative channel, which is hosted on [OSF](https://osf.io/2dfvp). This smaller file, like the original data, is saved as an [NWB](https://www.nwb.org) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ran the workshop setup script, you should have this file downloaded already. If not, the function we'll use to fetch it will download it for you. This function is called `fetch_data`, and can be imported from the `workshop_utils` module. This function will give us the file path to where the data is stored. We can then use the pynapple function `load_file` to load in the data, which is able to handle the NWB file type."
