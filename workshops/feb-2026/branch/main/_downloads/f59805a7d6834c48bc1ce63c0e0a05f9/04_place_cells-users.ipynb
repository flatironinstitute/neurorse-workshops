    "The data set we'll be looking at is from the manuscript [Diversity in neural firing dynamics supports both rigid and learned hippocampal sequences](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad1935). In this study, the authors collected electrophisiology data in rats across multiple sites in layer CA1 of hippocampus to extract the LFP alongside spiking activity of many simultaneous pyramidal units. In each recording session, data were collected while the rats explored a novel environment (a linear or circular track), as well as during sleep before and after exploration. In our following analyses, we'll focus on the exploration period of a single rat and recording session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full dataset for this study can be accessed on [DANDI](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000044/0.210812.1516). Since the file size of a recording session can be large from the LFP saved for each recorded channel, we'll use a smaller file that contains the spiking activity and the LFP from a single, representative channel, which is hosted on [OSF](https://osf.io/2dfvp). This smaller file, like the original data, is saved as an [NWB](https://www.nwb.org) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ran the workshop setup script, you should have this file downloaded already. If not, the function we'll use to fetch it will download it for you. This function is called `fetch_data`, and can be imported from the `workshop_utils` module. This function will give us the file path to where the data is stored. We can then use the pynapple function `load_file` to load in the data, which is able to handle the NWB file type."

    "Finally we'll do a popular analysis in the rat hippocampus sphere: Bayesian decoding. This analysis is an elegent application of Bayes' rule in predicting the animal's location (or other behavioral variables) given neural activity at some point in time. Refer to the dropdown box below for a more in-depth explanation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our goal is to compute the unknown posterior $P(position|spikes)$ given known prior $P(position)$ and known likelihood $P(spikes|position)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(position)$, also known as the *occupancy*, is the probability that the animal is occupying some position. This can be computed exactly by the proportion of the total time spent at each position, but in many cases it is sufficient to estimate the occupancy as a uniform distribution, i.e. it is equally likely for the animal to occupy any location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next term, $P(spikes|position)$, which is the probability of seeing some sequence of spikes across all neurons at some position. Computing this relys on the following assumptions:\n",
    "1. Neurons fire according to a Poisson process (i.e. their spiking activity follows a Poisson distribution)\n",
    "2. Neurons fire independently from one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "While neither of these assumptions are strictly true, they are generally reasonable for pyramidal cells in hippocampus and allow us to simplify our computation of $P(spikes|position)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first assumption gives us an equation for $P(spikes|position)$ for a single neuron, which we'll call $P(spikes_i|position)$ to differentiate it from $P(spikes|position) = P(spikes_1,spikes_2,...,spikes_N|position)$, or the total probability across all $N$ neurons. The equation we get is that of the Poisson distribution:\n",

    "P(spikes_i|position) = \\frac{(\\tau f_i(position))^n e^{-\\tau f_i(position)}}{n!}\n",

    "where $f_i(position)$ is the firing rate of the neuron at position $(position)$ (i.e. the tuning curve), $\\tau$ is the width of the time window over which we're computing the probability, and $n$ is the total number of times the neuron spiked in the time window of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second assumptions allows us to simply combine the probabilities of individual neurons. Recall the product rule for independent events: $P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)$ if $A$ and $B$ are independent. Treating neurons as independent, then, gives us the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(spikes|position) = \\prod_i P(spikes_i|position)\n",

    "\n",
    "Another way of putting it is $P(spikes)$ is the normalization factor such that $\\sum_{position} P(position|spikes) = 1$, which is achived by dividing the numerator by its sum.\n",

This is equivalent to applying a moving sum to adjacent bins, where the width of the kernel is the number of adjacent bins being added together.

This combines the accuracy of using a wider time bin with the temporal resolution of a shorter time bin.\n",
