    "The data set we'll be looking at is from the manuscript [Diversity in neural firing dynamics supports both rigid and learned hippocampal sequences](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad1935). In this study, the authors collected electrophisiology data in rats across multiple sites in layer CA1 of hippocampus to extract the LFP alongside spiking activity of many simultaneous pyramidal units. In each recording session, data were collected while the rats explored a novel environment (a linear or circular track), as well as during sleep before and after exploration. In our following analyses, we'll focus on the exploration period of a single rat and recording session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full dataset for this study can be accessed on [DANDI](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000044/0.210812.1516). Since the file size of a recording session can be large from the LFP saved for each recorded channel, we'll use a smaller file that contains the spiking activity and the LFP from a single, representative channel, which is hosted on [OSF](https://osf.io/2dfvp). This smaller file, like the original data, is saved as an [NWB](https://www.nwb.org) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ran the workshop setup script, you should have this file downloaded already. If not, the function we'll use to fetch it will download it for you. This function is called `fetch_data`, and can be imported from the `workshop_utils` module. This function will give us the file path to where the data is stored. We can then use the pynapple function `load_file` to load in the data, which is able to handle the NWB file type."

    "As an initial visualization of phase precession, we'll look at a single traversal of the linear track. First, let's look at how the timing of an example unit's spikes lines up with the LFP and theta. To plot the spike times on the same axis as the LFP, we'll use the pynapple object's method [`value_from`](https://pynapple.org/generated/pynapple.TsGroup.value_from.html) to align the spike times with the theta amplitude. For our spiking data, this will find the amplitude closest in time to each spike. Let's start by applying [`value_from`](https://pynapple.org/generated/pynapple.TsGroup.value_from.html) on unit 177, who's place field is cenetered on the linear track, using `theta_band` to align the amplityde of the filtered LFP.\n",

We can improve the decoder error by smoothing the spike counts. [`nap.decode_bayes`](https://pynapple.org/generated/pynapple.process.decoding.html#pynapple.process.decoding.decode_bayes) provides the option to do this for you by specifying `sliding_window_size`, which specifies the width, in number of bins, of a uniform (all ones) kernel to convolve with the spike counts. This is equivalent to applying a moving sum to adjacent bins, where the width of the kernel is the number of adjacent bins being added together. This is equivalent to counting spikes in a *sliding window* that shifts in shorter increments than the window's width, resulting in bins that overlap. This combines the accuracy of using a wider time bin with the temporal resolution of a shorter time bin.\n",
