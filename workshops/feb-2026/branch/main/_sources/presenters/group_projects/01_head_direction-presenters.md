# Analyzing head-direction cells with Pynapple
This notebook has had all its explanatory text removed and has not been run.
 It is intended to be downloaded and run locally (or on the provided binder)
 while listening to the presenter's explanation. In order to see the fully
 rendered of this notebook, go [here](../../full/group_projects/01_head_direction.md)



In this tutorial, we will learn how to use pynapple to analyze electrophysiological data.

We will analyze extracellular recordings of head-direction cells recorded in the 
anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (ADn) of the mouse. We will use a NWB file containing spike times of neurons and the head-direction of the animal over time.
We will study the relationship between neurons during wakefulness and sleep with cross-correlograms.

The pynapple documentation can be found [here](https://pynapple.org).

We will use pynapple to do the following tasks:

1. Loading a NWB file
2. Compute tuning curves
3. Compute cross-correlograms

Let's start by importing all the packages.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

import pynapple as nap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import nemos as nmo

# some helper plotting functions
import workshop_utils

# configure pynapple to ignore conversion warning
nap.nap_config.suppress_conversion_warnings = True

# configure plots some
plt.style.use(nmo.styles.plot_style)
```

## Fetch and load data



The dataset we will use is from this study : [Peyrache et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3968).

If you ran the workshop setup script, you should have this file downloaded already. 
If not, the function we'll use to fetch it will download it for you. 
This function is called `fetch_data`, and can be imported from the `workshop_utils` module. 
This function will give us the file path to where the data is stored. 



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

path = workshop_utils.fetch_data("Mouse32-140822.nwb")

print(path)
```



Pynapple provides the convenience function `nap.load_file` for loading a NWB file.

**Question:** Can you open the NWB file giving the variable `path` to the function `load_file` and call the output `data`?



```{code-cell} ipython3
data = nap.load_file(path)

print(data)
```



The content of the NWB file is not loaded yet. The object `data` behaves like a dictionary.
It contains multiple entries corresponding to different data types stored in the NWB file.
In NWB files, spike times are stored in the `units` entry.

**Question:** Can you load the spike times from the NWB and call the variables `spikes`?



```{code-cell} ipython3
spikes = data["units"]  # Get spike timings
print(spikes)
```



There are a lot of neurons. The neurons that interest us are the neurons labeled `adn`. 

**Question:** Using the slicing method of your choice, can you select only the neurons in `adn` that are above 2 Hz firing rate?

THere multiple options here. As a reminder, metadatas can be accessed like a dictionary or as attributes. There are also
functions that can help you filter neurons based on metadata.

1. `spikes.label` returns a pandas Series with the metadata of the neurons.
2. `spikes['label']` returns a pandas Series with the metadata of the neurons.
3. Functions like [`spikes.getby_category`](https://pynapple.org/generated/pynapple.TsGroup.getby_category.html#pynapple.TsGroup.getby_category)
    or [`spikes.getby_threshold`](https://pynapple.org/generated/pynapple.TsGroup.getby_threshold.html#pynapple.TsGroup.getby_threshold) can help you filter neurons based on metadata.



```{code-cell} ipython3
spikes = spikes[(spikes.location=='adn') & (spikes.rate>2.0)]

print(len(spikes))
```



The NWB file contains other information about the recording. `ry` contains the value of the head-direction of the animal over time. 

**Question:** Can you extract the angle of the animal in a variable called `angle` and print it?



```{code-cell} ipython3
angle = data["ry"]
print(angle)
```



But are the data actually loaded or not?
If you look at the type of `angle`, you will see that it is a `Tsd` object.
But what about the underlying data array?
The underlying data array is stored in the property `d` of the `Tsd` object.
If you print it, you will see that it is a `h5py` array.
By default, data are lazy-loaded. This can be useful when reading larger than memory array from disk with memory map.



```{code-cell} ipython3
print(angle.d)
```



The animal was recorded during wakefulness and sleep. 

**Question:** Can you extract the behavioral intervals in a variable called `epochs`?



```{code-cell} ipython3
epochs = data["epochs"]

print(epochs)
```



NWB file can save intervals with multiple labels. The object `IntervalSet` includes the labels as a metadata object.

**Question:** Using the column `tags`, can you create one `IntervalSet` object for intervals labeled `wake` and one `IntervalSet` object for intervals labeled `sleep`?



```{code-cell} ipython3
wake_ep = epochs[epochs.tags=="wake"]
sleep_ep = epochs[epochs.tags=="sleep"]
```

## Compute tuning curves



Now we have 
- spikes
- a behavioral feature (i.e. head-direction), 
- epochs corresponding to when the feature is defined (i.e. when the head-direction was recorded).

We can compute tuning curves, i.e. the firing rate of neurons as a function of head-direction. 
We want to know how the firing rate of each neuron changes as a function of the head-direction of the animal during wakefulness.

To do this in pynapple, all you need is the call of a single function : `nap.compute_tuning_curves`!

**Question:** can you compute the firing rate of ADn units as a function of heading direction, i.e. a head-direction tuning curve and call the variable `tuning_curves`?



```{code-cell} ipython3
tuning_curves = nap.compute_tuning_curves(
    data=spikes,
    features=angle, 
    bins=61, 
    epochs = angle.time_support,
    range=(0, 2 * np.pi),
    feature_names = ["angle"]
    )

tuning_curves
```



The output is a xarray object indexed by neuron and head\-direction: the first dimension corresponds to neurons, 
the second to angular bins, and additional metadata fields are included.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

fig = plt.figure()
plt.subplot(221)
tuning_curves[0].plot()
# plt.plot(tuning_curves[0])
plt.subplot(222,projection='polar')
plt.plot(tuning_curves.angle, tuning_curves[0].values)
plt.subplot(223)
tuning_curves[1].plot()
plt.subplot(224,projection='polar')
plt.plot(tuning_curves.angle, tuning_curves[1].values)
plt.tight_layout()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/01-00.png")
```



Most of those neurons are head-directions neurons.

The next cell allows us to get a quick estimate of the neurons's preferred direction. 
Since this is a lot of xarray wrangling, it is given.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

pref_ang = tuning_curves.idxmax(dim="angle")

print(pref_ang)
```



The variable `pref_ang` contains the preferred direction of each neuron. 
Now this information can be useful to add it to the metainformation of the `spikes` object since it is neuron-specific information.

**Question:** Can you add it to the metainformation of `spikes`? The metadata field should be called `pref_ang`.

Hint :

There are multiple ways of doing this:
```
tsgroup['label'] = metadata
tsgroup.label = metadata
tsgroup.set_info(label=metadata)
```



```{code-cell} ipython3
# spikes['pref_ang'] = pref_ang
spikes.set_info(pref_ang = pref_ang)

spikes
```



This index maps a neuron to a preferred angular direction between 0 and 2pi. 
Let's visualize the spiking activity of the neurons based on their preferred direction 
as well as the head-direction of the animal. To make it easier to see, we will restrict the data to a small epoch.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

ex_ep = nap.IntervalSet(start=8910, end=8960)

fig = plt.figure()
plt.subplot(211)
plt.plot(angle.restrict(ex_ep))
plt.ylim(0, 2*np.pi)

plt.subplot(212)
plt.plot(spikes.restrict(ex_ep).to_tsd("pref_ang"), '|')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/01-01.png")
```

## Compute correlograms



We see that some neurons have a correlated activity meaning they tend to fire together, while others have an anti-correlated activity meaning when one neuron fires, the other does not.
Can we quantify this correlation between pairs of neurons? To do this, we can compute cross-correlograms between pairs of neurons.
A cross-correlogram measures the correlation between the spike trains of two neurons as a function of time lag. It counts how often spikes from one neuron occur at different time lags relative to spikes from another neuron.
In pynapple, we use the function `nap.compute_crosscorrelogram` to compute cross-correlograms between pairs of neurons.

**Question:** Can you compute cross-correlograms during wake for all pairs of neurons and call it `cc_wake`?



```{code-cell} ipython3
cc_wake = nap.compute_crosscorrelogram(spikes, binsize=0.2, windowsize=20.0, ep=wake_ep)
```



The output is a pandas DataFrame where each column is a pair of neurons. All pairs of neurons are computed automatically.
The index shows the time lag.
Let's visualize some cross-correlograms. 
To make things easier, we will focus on two pairs of neurons: one pair that fires for the same direction and one pair that fires for opposite directions.

The pair (7, 20) fires for the same direction while the pair (7, 26) fires for opposite directions. 

To index pandas columns, you can do `cc[(7, 20)]`.

To index xarray tuning curves, you can do `tuning_curves.sel(unit=[7,20])`



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

index = spikes.keys()


fig = plt.figure()
plt.subplot(221)
tuning_curves.sel(unit=[7,20]).plot(x='angle', hue='unit')
plt.title("Tuning curves")
plt.subplot(222)
plt.plot(cc_wake[(7, 20)])
plt.xlabel("Time lag (s)")
plt.title("Cross-corr.")
plt.subplot(223)
tuning_curves.sel(unit=[7,26]).plot(x='angle', hue='unit')
plt.title("Tuning curves")
plt.subplot(224)
plt.plot(cc_wake[(7, 26)])
plt.xlabel("Time lag (s)")
plt.title("Cross-corr.")
plt.tight_layout()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/01-02.png")
```



As you can see, the pair of neurons that fire for the same direction have a positive correlation at time lag 0, meaning they tend to fire together.
The pair of neurons that fire for opposite directions have a negative correlation at time lag 0, meaning when one neuron fires, the other does not.

Pairwise correlation were computed during wakefulness. The activity of the neurons was also recorded during sleep.

**Question:** can you compute the cross-correlograms during sleep?



```{code-cell} ipython3
cc_sleep = nap.compute_crosscorrelogram(spikes, 0.02, 1.0, ep=sleep_ep)
```



Let's visualize the cross-correlograms during wake and sleep for the pair of neurons that fire for the same direction 
and the pair of neurons that fire for opposite directions.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

fig = plt.figure()
plt.subplot(231)
tuning_curves.sel(unit=[7,20]).plot(x='angle', hue='unit')
plt.title("Tuning curves")
plt.subplot(232)
plt.plot(cc_wake[(7, 20)])
plt.xlabel("Time lag (s)")
plt.title("Wake")
plt.subplot(233)
plt.plot(cc_sleep[(7, 20)])
plt.xlabel("Time lag (s)")
plt.title("Sleep")
plt.subplot(234)
tuning_curves.sel(unit=[7,26]).plot(x='angle', hue='unit')
plt.subplot(235)
plt.plot(cc_wake[(7, 26)])
plt.xlabel("Time lag (s)")
plt.subplot(236)
plt.plot(cc_sleep[(7, 26)])
plt.xlabel("Time lag (s)")
plt.tight_layout()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/01-03.png")
```



What does it mean for the relationship between cells here? Remember that during sleep, the animal is not moving and therefore the head-direction is not defined.
