# Fitting a population GLM model with Nemos
This notebook has had all its explanatory text removed and has not been run.
 It is intended to be downloaded and run locally (or on the provided binder)
 while listening to the presenter's explanation. In order to see the fully
 rendered of this notebook, go [here](../../full/group_projects/02_population_analysis_with_nemos.md)



This group project is focused on fitting a population GLM model to characterize the functional connectivity.

In the first part, we will use the same dataset as in the previous tutorial, which contains head-direction cells recorded from the antero-dorsal nucleus of the thalamus (ADN) of a mouse during wake and sleep.
In the previous notebook, we characterized the relationship between head-direction cells during wake and sleep. 
Cells that fire together during wake also fire together during sleep and cells that don't fire together during wake don't fire 
together during sleep. The goal here is to characterize this relationship with generalized linear model. 
Since cells have a functional relationship to each other, the activity of one cell should predict the activity of another cell.

In this group project, we will use nemos to do the following tasks:
1. Create spike history features
2. Fit a GLM model to a single neuron
3. Fit a GLM model with basis functions to reduce over-fitting
4. Fit a GLM model to all neurons to learn functional connectivity

In the second part, we will try to apply the same type of analysis to the calcium imaging dataset used in the first tutorial.

Let's start by importing all the packages.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

import workshop_utils
import pynapple as nap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import nemos as nmo

# some helper plotting functions
from nemos import _documentation_utils as doc_plots

# configure pynapple to ignore conversion warning
nap.nap_config.suppress_conversion_warnings = True

# configure plot style
plt.style.use(nmo.styles.plot_style)
```

## Part 1 : Modelling extracellular spike history effects with GLM 

### Fetching the data



We will use the same dataset as in the previous tutorial, which can be downloaded with the helper function `fetch_data`.
To speed up the session, the following code cell will download the data, load it with pynapple and extract the relevant 
variables:



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

path = workshop_utils.fetch_data("Mouse32-140822.nwb")
data = nap.load_file(path)
spikes = data["units"]  # Get spike timings
spikes = spikes[(spikes.location=='adn') & (spikes.rate>2.0)]  # Keep only ADN neurons with firing rate > 2Hz
angle = data["ry"] # Get head-direction signal
epochs = data["epochs"] # Get epochs
wake_ep = epochs[epochs.tags=="wake"]
sleep_ep = epochs[epochs.tags=="sleep"]
tuning_curves = nap.compute_tuning_curves(
    data=spikes,
    features=angle, 
    bins=61, 
    epochs = angle.time_support,
    range=(0, 2 * np.pi),
    feature_names = ["angle"]
    )
pref_ang = tuning_curves.idxmax(dim="angle")
spikes.set_info(pref_ang = pref_ang)

```

### Fitting a GLM to a single neuron



**Question : are neurons constantly tuned to head-direction and can we use it to predict the spiking activity of each neuron 
based only on the activity of other neurons?**

To fit the GLM faster, we will use only the first 3 min of wake.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# restrict wake epoch to first 3 minutes
wake_ep = nap.IntervalSet(
    start=wake_ep.start[0], end=wake_ep.start[0] + 3 * 60
)
```


To use the GLM, we need first to bin the spike trains. Here we use pynapple and the function `count`.

**Question: can you bin the spike trains in 10 ms bins during the `wake_ep` and call the variable `count`?**



```{code-cell} ipython3
bin_size = 0.01
count = spikes.count(bin_size, ep=wake_ep)

print(count.shape)
```



Above we defined `pref_ang` as the preferred direction of each neuron. `np.argsort(pref_ang.values)` gives you the order to sort the columns of count.
This is useful to visualize the activity of neurons based on their preferred direction.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

count = count[:, np.argsort(pref_ang.values)]
```



It's time to use NeMoS. Our end goal is to estimate the pairwise interaction between neurons.
This can be quantified with a GLM if we use the recent population spike history to predict the current time step.

To simplify our life, let's see first how we can model spike history effects in a single neuron.
The simplest approach is to use counts in fixed length window $i$, $y_{t-i}, \dots, y_{t-1}$ to predict the next
count $y_{t}$. 

Before starting the analysis, let's 

- **select a neuron (first column is good) from the `count` object (call the variable `neuron_count`)** 
- **Select the first 1.2 seconds of wake_ep for visualization. (call the epoch `epoch_one_spk`).**



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# select a neuron's spike count time series
neuron_count = count[:, 0]

# restrict to a smaller time interval
epoch_one_spk = nap.IntervalSet(
    start=count.time_support.start[0], end=count.time_support.start[0] + 1.2
)
```

#### Features Construction



Let's fix the spike history window size that we will use as predictor meaning how far back in time we want to look to predict the current rate.

Let's :
- Fix a history window of 800ms (0.8 seconds).
- Plot the result using `doc_plots.plot_history_window`



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# set the size of the spike history window in seconds
window_size_sec = 0.8

fig = doc_plots.plot_history_window(neuron_count, epoch_one_spk, window_size_sec);
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/02-04.png")
```



For each time point, we shift our window one bin at the time and vertically stack the spike count history in a matrix.
Each row of the matrix will be used as the predictors for the rate in the next bin (red narrow rectangle in
the figure).



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

doc_plots.run_animation(neuron_count, epoch_one_spk.start[0])
```



If $t$ is smaller than the window size, we won't have a full window of spike history for estimating the rate.
One may think of padding the window (with zeros for example) but this may generate weird border artifacts.
To avoid that, we can simply restrict our analysis to times $t$ larger than the window and NaN-pad earlier
time-points;

You can construct this feature matrix with the [`HistoryConv`](https://nemos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/basis/nemos.basis.HistoryConv.html#nemos.basis.HistoryConv) basis.

**Question: Can you:**
    - Convert the window size in number of bins (call it `window_size`)
    - Define an `HistoryConv` basis covering this window size (call it `history_basis`).
    - Create the feature matrix with `history_basis.compute_features` (call it `input_feature`).



```{code-cell} ipython3
# convert the prediction window to bins (by multiplying with the sampling rate)
window_size = int(window_size_sec * neuron_count.rate)
# define the history bases
history_basis = nmo.basis.HistoryConv(window_size)
# create the feature matrix
input_feature = history_basis.compute_features(neuron_count)
```



NeMoS NaN pads if there aren't enough samples to predict the counts.
 


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# print the NaN indices along the time axis
print("NaN indices:\n", np.where(np.isnan(input_feature[:, 0]))[0]) 
```



The binned counts originally have shape "number of samples", we should check that the
dimension are matching our expectation



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

print(f"Time bins in counts: {neuron_count.shape[0]}")
print(f"Convolution window size in bins: {window_size}")
print(f"Feature shape: {input_feature.shape}")
```



We can visualize the output for a few time bins



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

suptitle = "Input feature: Count History"
neuron_id = 0
fig = workshop_utils.plot_features(input_feature, count.rate, suptitle)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/02-05.png")
```



As you may see, the time axis is backward, this happens because under the hood, the basis is using the convolution operator which flips the time axis.
This is equivalent, as we can interpret the result as how much a spike will affect the future rate.
In the previous tutorial our feature was 1-dimensional (just the current), now
instead the feature dimension is 80, because our bin size was 0.01 sec and the window size is 0.8 sec.
We can learn these weights by maximum likelihood by fitting a GLM.



#### Fitting a single neuron model



When working a real dataset, it is good practice to train your models on a chunk of the data and
use the other chunk to assess the model performance. This process is known as "cross-validation".
There is no unique strategy on how to cross-validate your model; What works best
depends on the characteristic of your data (time series or independent samples,
presence or absence of trials), and that of your model. Here, for simplicity use the first
half of the wake epochs for training and the second half for testing. This is a reasonable
choice if the statistics of the neural activity does not change during the course of
the recording. We will learn about better cross-validation strategies with other
examples.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# construct the train and test epochs
duration = input_feature.time_support.tot_length("s")
start = input_feature.time_support["start"]
end = input_feature.time_support["end"]

# define the interval sets
first_half = nap.IntervalSet(start, start + duration / 2)
second_half = nap.IntervalSet(start + duration / 2, end)
```



**Question: Can you fit the glm to the first half of the recording and visualize the maximum likelihood weights?**

The model used should be a `nmo.glm.GLM` with the solver `LBFGS`.



```{code-cell} ipython3
# define the GLM object
model = nmo.glm.GLM(solver_name="LBFGS")

# Fit over the training epochs
model.fit(
    input_feature.restrict(first_half),
    neuron_count.restrict(first_half)
)
```



The weights represent the effect of a spike at time lag $i$ on the rate at time $t$. The next cell display the learned weights.
The model should be called `model` from the previous cell.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

fig = plt.figure()
plt.title("Spike History Weights")
plt.plot(np.arange(window_size) / count.rate, np.squeeze(model.coef_), lw=2, label="GLM raw history 1st Half")
plt.axhline(0, color="k", lw=0.5)
plt.xlabel("Time From Spike (sec)")
plt.ylabel("Kernel")
plt.legend()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/02-06.png")
```



The response in the previous figure seems noise added to a decay, therefore the response
can be described with fewer degrees of freedom. In other words, it looks like we
are using way too many weights to describe a simple response.
If we are correct, what would happen if we re-fit the weights on the other half of the data?





**Question: Can you fit a new model on the second half of the data and call it `model_second_half`?**



```{code-cell} ipython3
# fit on the other half of the data

model_second_half = nmo.glm.GLM(solver_name="LBFGS")
model_second_half.fit(
    input_feature.restrict(second_half),
    neuron_count.restrict(second_half)
)
```



Let's plot the weights learned on the second half of the data and compare them to those learned on the first half.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

fig = plt.figure()
plt.title("Spike History Weights")
plt.plot(np.arange(window_size) / count.rate, np.squeeze(model.coef_),
         label="GLM raw history 1st Half", lw=2)
plt.plot(np.arange(window_size) / count.rate,  np.squeeze(model_second_half.coef_),
         color="orange", label="GLM raw history 2nd Half", lw=2)
plt.axhline(0, color="k", lw=0.5)
plt.xlabel("Time From Spike (sec)")
plt.ylabel("Kernel")
plt.legend()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/02-07.png")
```



What can we conclude?

The fast fluctuations are inconsistent across fits, indicating that
they are probably capturing noise, a phenomenon known as over-fitting;
On the other hand, the decaying trend is fairly consistent, even if
our estimate is noisy. You can imagine how things could get
worst if we needed a finer temporal resolution, such 1ms time bins
(which would require 800 coefficients instead of 80).
What can we do to mitigate over-fitting now?



#### Reducing feature dimensionality


Let's see how to use NeMoS' `basis` module to reduce dimensionality and avoid over-fitting!
For history-type inputs, we'll use again the raised cosine log-stretched basis,
[Pillow et al., 2005](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/47/11003).



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

fig = doc_plots.plot_basis()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/02-08.png")
```



We can initialize the `RaisedCosineLogConv` by providing the number of basis functions 
and the window size for the convolution. With more basis functions, we'll be able to represent 
the effect of the corresponding input with the higher precision, at the cost of adding additional parameters.

**Question: Can you define the basis `RaisedCosineLogConv`and name it `basis`?**

Basis parameters:
- 8 basis functions.
- Window size of 0.8sec.



```{code-cell} ipython3
# a basis object can be instantiated in "conv" mode for convolving  the input.
basis = nmo.basis.RaisedCosineLogConv(
    n_basis_funcs=8, window_size=window_size
)
```



Our spike history predictor was huge: every possible 80 time point chunk of the
data, for $144 \cdot 10^4$ total numbers. By using this basis set we can instead reduce
the predictor to 8 numbers for every 80 time point window for $144 \cdot 10^3$ total
numbers, an order of magnitude less. With 1ms bins we would have
achieved 2 order of magnitude reduction in input size. This is a huge benefit
in terms of memory allocation and, computing time. As an additional benefit,
we will reduce over-fitting.

Let's see our basis in action. We can "compress" spike history feature by convolving the basis
with the counts (without creating the large spike history feature matrix).
This can be performed in NeMoS by calling the `compute_features` method of basis.

**Question: Can you:**
- Convolve the counts with the basis functions. (Call the output `conv_spk`)
- Print the shape of `conv_spk` and compare it to `input_feature`.



```{code-cell} ipython3
# equivalent to
# `nmo.convolve.create_convolutional_predictor(basis_kernels, neuron_count)`
conv_spk = basis.compute_features(neuron_count)

print(f"Raw count history as feature: {input_feature.shape}")
print(f"Compressed count history as feature: {conv_spk.shape}")
```



Let’s focus on two small time windows and visualize the features, which result from convolving the counts with the basis elements.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# Visualize the convolution results
epoch_one_spk = nap.IntervalSet(8917.5, 8918.5)
epoch_multi_spk = nap.IntervalSet(8979.2, 8980.2)

fig = doc_plots.plot_convolved_counts(neuron_count, conv_spk, epoch_one_spk, epoch_multi_spk)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/02-09.png")
```

#### Fit a GLM with basis features with reduced dimensionality



Now that we have our "compressed" history feature matrix, we can fit the parameters for a new GLM model using these features.

**Question: Can you fit the model using the compressed features? Call it `model_basis`.**



```{code-cell} ipython3
# use restrict on interval set training
model_basis = nmo.glm.GLM(solver_name="LBFGS")
model_basis.fit(conv_spk.restrict(first_half), neuron_count.restrict(first_half))
```



(head-direction-basis-presenters)=

We can plot the resulting response, noting that the weights we just learned needs to be "expanded" back
to the original `window_size` dimension by multiplying them with the basis kernels.
We have now 8 coefficients,



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

print(model_basis.coef_)
```



In order to get the response of a neuron in response to its history, we need to multiply the coefficients by their corresponding
basis function, and sum them.

Let's do that now. We can reconstruct the history filter by multiplying the basis kernels with the learned coefficients.

We can get the basis kernels by calling the `evaluate_on_grid` method of the basis object.

Then we can multiply the basis kernels with the coefficients using `np.matmul`.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# get the basis function kernels
_, basis_kernels = basis.evaluate_on_grid(window_size)

# multiply with the weights
self_connection = np.matmul(basis_kernels, model_basis.coef_)

print(self_connection.shape)
```



Let's check if our new estimate does a better job in terms of over-fitting. We can do that
by visual comparison, as we did previously. Let's fit the second half of the dataset.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# fit on the other half of the data
model_basis_second_half = nmo.glm.GLM(solver_name="LBFGS").fit(
    conv_spk.restrict(second_half), neuron_count.restrict(second_half)
)
self_connection_second_half = np.matmul(basis_kernels, model_basis_second_half.coef_)
```



Let's plot the weights learned on the second half of the data and compare them to those learned on the first half.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

time = np.arange(window_size) / count.rate
fig = plt.figure()
plt.title("Spike History Weights")
plt.plot(time, np.squeeze(model.coef_), "k", alpha=0.3, label="GLM raw history 1st half")
plt.plot(time, np.squeeze(model_second_half.coef_), alpha=0.3, color="orange", label="GLM raw history 2nd half")
plt.plot(time, self_connection, "--k", lw=2, label="GLM basis 1st half")
plt.plot(time, self_connection_second_half, color="orange", lw=2, ls="--", label="GLM basis 2nd half")
plt.axhline(0, color="k", lw=0.5)
plt.xlabel("Time from spike (sec)")
plt.ylabel("Weight")
plt.legend()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/02-10.png")
```



Let's see if the basis model improves prediction of the firing rate. Here we will compare the firing rate predicted
by the two models on the whole dataset. The model should be called `model` and `model_basis` from the previous cells.

**Question: Can you:**
- Predict the rates from `model` and `model_basis`? Call it `rate_history` and `rate_basis`.



```{code-cell} ipython3
rate_basis = model_basis.predict(conv_spk) * conv_spk.rate
rate_history = model.predict(input_feature) * conv_spk.rate
```



Let's plot the predicted rates over a short window not used for training.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# plot the rates
fig = doc_plots.plot_rates_and_smoothed_counts(
    neuron_count,
    {"Self-connection raw history":rate_history, "Self-connection basis": rate_basis}
);
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/02-11.png")
```

#### All-to-all Connectivity



The same approach can be applied to the whole population. Now the firing rate of a neuron
is predicted not only by its own count history, but also by the rest of the
simultaneously recorded population. We can convolve the basis with the counts of each neuron
to get an array of predictors of shape, `(num_time_points, num_neurons * num_basis_funcs)`.



##### Preparing the features



**Question: Can you:**
- Re-define the basis?
- Convolve all counts? Call the output in `convolved_count`.
- Print the output shape?

Since this time we are convolving more than one neuron, we need to reset the expected input shape. 
This can be done by passing the population counts to the `set_input_shape` method.



```{code-cell} ipython3
# reset the input shape by passing the pop. count
print(count.shape)
print(152/8)

basis.set_input_shape(count)

# convolve all the neurons
convolved_count = basis.compute_features(count)
```



Check the dimension to make sure it make sense.

Shape should be `(n_samples, n_basis_func * n_neurons)`



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

print(f"Convolved count shape: {convolved_count.shape}")
```

(head-direction-fit-presenters)=
##### Fitting the Model



This is an all-to-all neurons model.
We are using the class [`PopulationGLM`](https://nemos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/glm/nemos.glm.PopulationGLM.html) to fit the whole population at once.


Once we condition on past activity, log-likelihood of the population is the sum of the log-likelihood



**Question: Can you:**
- Fit a `PopulationGLM`? Call the object `model`. Solver should be `LBFGS`.
- Use Ridge regularization with a `regularizer_strength=0.1`?
- Print the shape of the estimated coefficients.



```{code-cell} ipython3
model = nmo.glm.PopulationGLM(
    regularizer="Ridge",
    solver_name="LBFGS",
    regularizer_strength=0.1
    ).fit(convolved_count, count)

print(f"Model coefficients shape: {model.coef_.shape}")
```

##### Comparing model predictions.



Predict the rate (counts are already sorted by tuning prefs)

**Question: Can you:**
- Predict the firing rate of each neuron? Call it `predicted_firing_rate`.
- Convert the rate from spike/bin to spike/sec?



```{code-cell} ipython3
predicted_firing_rate = model.predict(convolved_count) * conv_spk.rate
```



Now we can visualize the tuning curves predicted by the model as well as the real tuning curves and the predicted firing rate.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# use pynapple for time axis for all variables plotted for tick labels in imshow
fig = workshop_utils.plot_head_direction_tuning_model(tuning_curves, spikes, angle, 
                                                predicted_firing_rate, threshold_hz=1,
                                                start=8910, end=8960, cmap_label="hsv");
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/02-12.png")
```



Let's see if our firing rate predictions improved and in what sense.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

fig = doc_plots.plot_rates_and_smoothed_counts(
    neuron_count,
    {"Self-connection: raw history": rate_history,
     "Self-connection: basis": rate_basis,
     "All-to-all: basis": predicted_firing_rate[:, 0]}
)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/02-13.png")
```

##### Visualizing the connectivity



Finally, we can extract and visualize the pairwise interactions between neurons.

**Question: Can you extract the weights and store it in a `(n_neurons, n_neurons, n_basis_funcs)` array? 



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# original shape of the weights
print(f"GLM coeff: {model.coef_.shape}")
```



You can use the `split_by_feature` method of `basis` for this. It will reshape the coefficient vector into a 3D array.

![Reshape coefficients](../../_static/coeff_reshape.png)



```{code-cell} ipython3
# split the coefficient vector along the feature axis (axis=0)
weights_dict = basis.split_by_feature(model.coef_, axis=0)

# the output is a dict with key the basis label, 
# and value the reshaped coefficients
weights = weights_dict["RaisedCosineLogConv"]
print(f"Re-shaped coeff: {weights.shape}")
```



The shape is `(sender_neuron, num_basis, receiver_neuron)`.

Let's reconstruct the coupling filters by multiplying the weights with the basis functions. 
Here we use `np.einsum` for that. It's a powerful function for summing products of arrays over specified axes.
In this case, the operation is :
(sender_neuron, num_basis, receiver_neuron) x (time lag, num_basis) -> (sender_neuron, receiver_neuron, time lag)



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

responses = np.einsum("jki,tk->ijt", weights, basis_kernels)

print(responses.shape)
```



Finally, we can visualize the pairwise interactions by plotting
all the coupling filters.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

predicted_tuning_curves = nap.compute_tuning_curves(
    data=predicted_firing_rate,
    features=angle, 
    bins=61, 
    epochs = angle.time_support,
    range=(0, 2 * np.pi),
    feature_names = ["angle"]
    )

                                                 
fig = workshop_utils.plot_coupling_filters(responses, predicted_tuning_curves)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/02-14.png")
```



These coupling filters represent the influence of one neuron on another over time. 
They have been sorted based on the preferred head-direction of each neuron.
Note that those neurons are not synaptically connected, but they have a functional relationship based on their tuning 
to head-direction.


## Part 2 : Modelling calcium imaging data with GLM

### Loading and preprocessing the data


We will use the same data loading and preprocessing steps as in the previous group project. This part is more open-ended, 
and you can explore different modeling choices.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]
path = nmo.fetch.fetch_data("A0670-221213.nwb")
data = nap.load_file(path)
transients = data["RoiResponseSeries"][:]  # Get calcium transients
angle = data["ry"] # Get head-direction signal
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]
tuning_curves = nap.compute_tuning_curves(
    data=transients,
    features=angle, 
    bins=61, 
    epochs = angle.time_support,
    range=(0, 2 * np.pi),
    feature_names = ["angle"]
    )
```



To speed up the analysis, the following code computes a Rayleigh test to select only neurons that are significantly tuned to head-direction.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]
C = np.sum(tuning_curves.values * np.cos(tuning_curves.angle.values), axis=1) / np.sum(tuning_curves.values, axis=1)
S = np.sum(tuning_curves.values * np.sin(tuning_curves.angle.values), axis=1) / np.sum(tuning_curves.values, axis=1)
R = np.sqrt(C**2 + S**2)
Z = tuning_curves.shape[1] * R**2
p_value = np.exp(-Z)

tokeep_neurons = np.where(p_value < 0.01)[0]
transients = transients[:, tokeep_neurons]
tuning_curves = tuning_curves[tokeep_neurons]
print(f"Number of neurons after tuning selection: {transients.shape[1]}")
```



Finally, we sort the neurons based on their preferred head-direction.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]
pref_ang = tuning_curves.idxmax(dim="angle")
sort_idx = np.argsort(pref_ang.values)
transients = transients[:, sort_idx]
tuning_curves = tuning_curves[sort_idx]
pref_ang = pref_ang[sort_idx]
transients.set_info(pref_ang=pref_ang)
print(transients) 
```

### Basis functions for calcium data



Here we can use the same `RaisedCosineLogConv` basis, but with a larger window size to capture the slower dynamics of calcium signals.



```{code-cell} ipython3
# define the basis for calcium data
calcium_window_size_sec = 2.0  # 2 seconds window
calcium_window_size = int(calcium_window_size_sec * transients.rate)
calcium_basis = nmo.basis.RaisedCosineLogConv(
    n_basis_funcs=4, window_size=calcium_window_size
)
print(calcium_window_size)
calcium_basis
```

### Preparing the features


We can convolve the calcium transients with the basis functions to get the feature matrix.


```{code-cell} ipython3
# convolve all the neurons
calcium_convolved = calcium_basis.compute_features(transients)
print(f"Convolved calcium shape: {calcium_convolved.shape}")
```

### Fitting the Population GLM


We can fit a `PopulationGLM` to the calcium data using a Gamma observation model, which is more appropriate for continuous-valued data.

Similar to before, we will create a train-test split using the first and second half of the data.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]
duration = calcium_convolved.time_support.tot_length("s")
start = calcium_convolved.time_support["start"]
end = calcium_convolved.time_support["end"]
training_ep = nap.IntervalSet(start, start + duration / 2)
testing_ep = nap.IntervalSet(start + duration / 2, end)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
calcium_model = nmo.glm.PopulationGLM(
    observation_model="Gamma",
    regularizer="Ridge",
    solver_name="LBFGS",
    regularizer_strength=0.1
    ).fit(calcium_convolved.restrict(training_ep), transients.restrict(training_ep))
print(f"Calcium model coefficients shape: {calcium_model.coef_.shape}")
```

### Predicting and visualizing the results


We can predict the calcium signals using the fitted model during the test epoch and visualize the results.


```{code-cell} ipython3
calcium_predicted = calcium_model.predict(calcium_convolved.restrict(testing_ep))
```


We can visualize the predicted calcium signals alongside the actual signals to assess the model's performance.


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]
ep_to_plot = nap.IntervalSet(testing_ep.start[0], testing_ep.start[0] + 100)  # Plot first 10 seconds of test epoch

fig = plt.figure()
plt.plot(transients.restrict(ep_to_plot)[:,0], label="Actual Calcium")
plt.plot(calcium_predicted.restrict(ep_to_plot)[:,0], label="Predicted Calcium")
plt.legend()
plt.title("Calcium Signal Prediction")
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Fluorescence Intensity")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]
fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/02-15.png")
```



Similar to the spike data, we can extract and visualize the coupling filters between neurons based on the fitted model.


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]
# split the coefficient vector along the feature axis (axis=0)
calcium_weights_dict = calcium_basis.split_by_feature(calcium_model.coef_, axis=0)
# The output is a dict with key the basis label, 
# and value the reshaped coefficients
calcium_weights = calcium_weights_dict["RaisedCosineLogConv"]
# reconstruct the coupling filters
time, basis_kernels = calcium_basis.evaluate_on_grid(calcium_window_size)
calcium_responses = np.einsum("jki,tk->ijt", calcium_weights, basis_kernels)
print(calcium_responses.shape)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]
fig = workshop_utils.plot_coupling_filters(calcium_responses, tuning_curves)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]
fig.savefig("../../_static/_check_figs/02-16.png")
```



These coupling filters represent the functional relationships between neurons based on their calcium signal.
Note that the slower dynamics of calcium signals may lead to different coupling patterns compared to spike data.

The end of this group project. You can explore further by trying different basis functions, regularization strengths, or observation models.
You can also try to incorporate external covariates, such as the head-direction signal, into the model.
You can try to downsample the data to see how it affects the model fitting and predictions (i.e. check `bin_average` in pynapple to downsample the transients).
