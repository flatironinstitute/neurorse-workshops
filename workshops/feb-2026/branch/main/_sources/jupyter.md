# Intro to Jupyter Lab

We will attempt to explain everything as we do it, but here's a quick cheat sheet to familiarize you with the most commonly-used shortcuts:

Together we will open up a new jupyter notebook and practice:
- Toggling between jupyter's command and edit mode (`Escape`, `Enter`).
- Navigating up and down the notebook (arrow keys).
- Creating a new cell above (`a`) and below (`b`) the current one.
- Running code cells, either keeping focus on the current cell (`Ctrl + Enter`) or advancing it to the next cell (`Shift + Enter`).
- Pulling up function docstrings (`Shift + Tab`).
- Copying (`c`) and pasting (`v`) cells.
- Ipython "magic" functions:
    - Display all currently-defined variables (`%whos`).
    - Automatically reload imported files (`%load_ext autoreload; %autoreload 2`)
