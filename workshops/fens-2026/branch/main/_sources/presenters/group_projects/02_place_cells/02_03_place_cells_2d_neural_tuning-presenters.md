# 2D neural tuning and model fitting
This notebook has had all its explanatory text removed and has not been run.
 It is intended to be downloaded and run locally (or on the provided binder)
 while listening to the presenter's explanation. In order to see the fully
 rendered of this notebook, go [here](../../../full/group_projects/02_place_cells/02_03_place_cells_2d_neural_tuning.md)


    
In this series of notebooks, we will review more advanced applications of pynapple; tuning curves, signal processing, and decoding; as well as fitting GLMs to the data using NeMoS. We'll apply these methods to demonstrate and visualize some well-known physiological properties of hippocampal activity, specifically phase presession of place cells and sequential coordination of place cell activity during theta oscillations.

This series is split into 4 notebooks:
1. Data wrangling, 1D neural tuning, and model fitting
2. Signal processing
3. (This notebook) 2D neural tuning and model fitting
4. Neural decoding

This notebook assumes you have already gone through the first notebook to explore the data. We'll reinitialize variables created in the first notebook that will be used here.

## Part 4: 2D neural tuning and model fitting

### Computing 2D tuning curves: position vs. phase



We can visualize phase precession as a 2D tuning curve over position and phase. We can compute this using the same function as the first notebook, [`nap.compute_tuning_curves`](https://pynapple.org/generated/pynapple.process.tuning_curves.html#pynapple.process.tuning_curves.compute_tuning_curves), but now passing `features` as a 2-column `TsdFrame` containing the two target features.





```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

sample_rate = 1250
theta_band = nap.apply_bandpass_filter(lfp, (6.0, 12.0), fs=sample_rate)
theta_phase = nap.compute_hilbert_phase(theta_band)
```



Now we need to combine `position` and `theta_phase` into a `TsdFrame`. For this to work, both variables must have the same length. We can achieve this by upsampling `position` to the length of `theta_phase` using the pynapple object method [`interpolate`](https://pynapple.org/generated/pynapple.Tsd.interpolate.html).



#### 1. Interpolate `position` to the time points of `theta_phase`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
upsampled_pos = position.interpolate(theta_phase)
```



Now we can combine `upsampled_pos` and `theta_phase` into a single `TsdFrame`. However, since comparing and merging time axes is nontrivial problem, pynapple does not allow us to do this directly. Instead, we need to extract the values from `upsampled_pos` and `theta_phase` and stack them together using `numpy`. Then we can define a new `TsdFrame` using the 2D feature array which we can use to compute 2D tuning curves.
  


#### 2. Stack `upsampled_pos` and `theta_phase` together into a single [`TsdFrame`](https://pynapple.org/generated/pynapple.TsdFrame.html)



- For stacking arrays, you can use a numpy function like [`np.stack`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.stack.html).
    - Tip: you may need to transpose to make sure time is in the first dimension of the stacked array
- Make sure to name your `TsdFrame` columns `"position"` and `"phase"`
  


```{code-cell} ipython3
feats = np.stack((upsampled_pos.values, theta_phase.values))
features = nap.TsdFrame(
    t=theta_phase.t,
    d=np.transpose(feats),
    time_support=upsampled_pos.time_support,
    columns=["position", "phase"],
)
features
```

#### 3. Use [`nap.compute_tuning_curves`](https://pynapple.org/generated/pynapple.process.tuning_curves.html#pynapple.process.tuning_curves.compute_tuning_curves) to compute 2D tuning curves for our subselected group of units, `good_spikes`, over position and phase stored in `features`.



- Use 50 bins for position and 30 bins for theta phase



```{code-cell} ipython3
tuning_curves = nap.compute_tuning_curves(good_spikes, features, bins=[50,30])
```



We can plot 2D tuning curves for each unit and phase precession in some example units.



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

neurons = [23, 33, 82, 175, 177, 220]
tc_norm = tuning_curves / tuning_curves.max(axis=(1,2))
p = tc_norm.sel(unit=neurons).plot(x="position", y="phase", col="unit", col_wrap=3, size=2, aspect=2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

p.fig.savefig("../../../_static/_check_figs/pc-12.png")
```



You should be able to notice a negative relationship between position and phase, characteristic of phase precession.



### Estimating 2D tuning curves using 2D basis functions


    
How can we model 2D tuning curves in a GLM? Similar the first notebook, we can define a 2D basis by using [NeMoS basis composition](https://nemos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/background/basis/plot_02_ND_basis_function.html), but instead *multiplying* two basis objects. In fact, we can use both addition and multiplication together to create arbitrarily complex, multidimensional basis objects.

First, we'll create a basis object for theta phase, specifically using [`CyclicBSplineEval`](https://nemos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/basis/nemos.basis.CyclicBSplineEval.html#nemos.basis.BSplineEval). We use this instead of `BSplineBasis` because the phase angle is a circular variable.



#### 4. Instantiate a [`CyclicBSplineEval`](https://nemos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/basis/nemos.basis.CyclicBSplineEval.html#nemos.basis.BSplineEval) basis object for phase, using 10 basis functions.



- Provide the label `"phase"` for the basis.
- If necessary, reinstantiate the basis objects for position, `position_basis`, and speed, `speed_basis`, as you did in **2.6**.



```{code-cell} ipython3
phase_basis = nmo.basis.CyclicBSplineEval(n_basis_funcs=10, label="phase")
```

#### 5. Create the full basis by multiplying `position_basis` and `phase_basis` and adding `speed_basis`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
full_basis = position_basis * phase_basis + speed_basis
full_basis
```



Before we can call `compute_features`, we need to make sure `theta_phase` has the same number of time points as `counts`. Since `theta_phase` has *more* time points than counts, we'll need to *downsample* the number of time points. We can do this using the pynapple object method [`bin_average`](https://pynapple.org/generated/pynapple.Tsd.bin_average.html). This function will average values within a specified bin size. We can achieve the same sampling rate by using the same bin size as we used for our spike counts.



#### 6. Downsample `theta_phase` using `bin_average` and a bin size of 0.01 s.

```{code-cell} ipython3
bin_theta = theta_phase.bin_average(0.01)
```

#### 7. Create a design matrix by calling `compute_features` on `full_basis` using `up_position`, `bin_theta`, and `up_speed`



- Note: `up_position` and `up_speed` were computed in the first notebook and have been redefined above.



```{code-cell} ipython3
X = full_basis.compute_features(up_position, bin_theta, up_speed)
```



Now we have everything we need to fit a GLM and predict the 2D tuning curves from our model.
  


#### 8. Fit a GLM by doing the following:



- Initialize `PopulationGLM`
- Use the "LBFGS" solver and pass `{"tol": 1e-12}` to `solver_kwargs`.
- Fit the data, passing the design matrix `X` and spike counts `counts` to the glm object.
    - Note: `counts` was computed in the first notebook and has been redefined above.
  


```{code-cell} ipython3
glm = nmo.glm.PopulationGLM(
    solver_kwargs=dict(tol=10**-12),
    solver_name="LBFGS"
)

glm.fit(X, counts)
```

#### 9. Use [`predict`](https://nemos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/glm/nemos.glm.GLM.predict.html#nemos.glm.GLM.predict) to calculated the predicted firing rate of our model. Use the predicted rate to compute predicted tuning curves using [`nap.compute_tuning_curves`](https://pynapple.org/generated/pynapple.process.tuning_curves.html#pynapple.process.tuning_curves.compute_tuning_curves).



- Remember to convert the predicted firing rate to spikes per second!
- Compute 1D tuning curves for position, using 50 and naming the feature `"position"`.
- Compute 1D tuning curves for speed, using 30 bins and naming the feature `"speed"`.
- Compute 2D tuning curves for position x phase using `predicted_rate` and the TsdFrame `features`, using 50 bins for position and 30 bins for phase.



```{code-cell} ipython3
predicted_rate = glm.predict(X) / bin_size

glm_pf = nap.compute_tuning_curves(predicted_rate, position, 50, feature_names=["position"])
glm_speed = nap.compute_tuning_curves(predicted_rate, speed, 30, feature_names=["speed"])
glm_pos_theta = nap.compute_tuning_curves(
    predicted_rate, features, [50, 30], epochs=forward_ep
)
```



We'll use a helper function from NeMoS to compare the predicted tuning curves to those computed from the data



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

from nemos import _documentation_utils as doc_plots
neuron = 82
idx = np.where(glm_pf.unit == neuron)[0][0]
fig = doc_plots.plot_position_phase_speed_tuning(
    place_fields.sel(unit=neuron),
    glm_pf[idx],
    speed_fields.sel(unit=neuron),
    glm_speed[idx],
    tuning_curves.sel(unit=neuron),
    glm_pos_theta[idx],
    )
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

fig.savefig("../../../_static/_check_figs/pc-13.png")
```

### Bonus Exercise



As an bonus, more open-ended exercise, we can investigate all the scientific decisions that we swept under the rug: should we regularize the model? What basis should we use? Do we need all inputs? If you're feeling ambitious, here are some suggestions to answer these questions:

- Try to fit and compare the results we just obtained with different models: 
  - A model with position as the only predictor.
  - A model with speed as the only predictor.
  - A model with phase as the only predictor
- Introduce L1 (Lasso) regularization and fit models with increasingly large penalty strengths ($\lambda$). Plot the regularization path showing how each coefficient changes with $\lambda$. Identify which coefficients remain non-zero longest as $\lambda$ increases - these correspond to the most informative predictors.
