```
## Pynapple

- Load the data using pynapple.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

path = workshop_utils.fetch_data("Achilles_10252013_EEG.nwb")
data = nap.load_file(path)
data
```

- Extract the spike times and mouse position.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

spikes = data["units"]
position = data["position"]
```


- Restrict data to when animal was traversing the linear track.


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

position = position.restrict(data["forward_ep"])
spikes = spikes.restrict(data["forward_ep"])
```


- Restrict neurons to only excitatory neurons, discarding neurons with a low-firing rate.


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

spikes = spikes.getby_category("cell_type")["pE"]
spikes = spikes.getby_threshold("rate", 0.3)
```
### Place fields


- Visualize the *place fields*: neuronal firing rate as a function of position.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

place_fields = nap.compute_1d_tuning_curves(spikes, position, 50, position.time_support)
workshop_utils.plot_place_fields(place_fields)
```


- For speed, we're only going to investigate the three neurons highlighted above.
- Bin spikes to counts at 100 Hz.
- Interpolate position to match spike resolution.


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

neurons = [82, 92, 220]
place_fields = place_fields[neurons]
spikes = spikes[neurons]
bin_size = .01
count = spikes.count(bin_size, ep=position.time_support)
position = position.interpolate(count, ep=count.time_support)
print(count.shape)
print(position.shape)
```
### Speed modulation


- Compute animal's speed for each epoch.


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

speed = []
# Analyzing each epoch separately avoids edge effects.
for s, e in position.time_support.values: 
    pos_ep = position.get(s, e)
    # Absolute difference of two consecutive points
    speed_ep = np.abs(np.diff(pos_ep)) 
    # Padding the edge so that the size is the same as the position/spike counts
    speed_ep = np.pad(speed_ep, [0, 1], mode="edge") 
    # Converting to cm/s 
    speed_ep = speed_ep * position.rate
    speed.append(speed_ep)

speed = nap.Tsd(t=position.t, d=np.hstack(speed), time_support=position.time_support)
print(speed.shape)
```


- Compute the tuning curve with pynapple's [`compute_1d_tuning_curves`](https://pynapple.org/generated/pynapple.process.tuning_curves.html#pynapple.process.tuning_curves.compute_1d_tuning_curves)


```{code-cell} ipython3
tc_speed = nap.compute_1d_tuning_curves(spikes, speed, 20, speed.time_support)
```


- Visualize the position and speed tuning for these neurons.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

fig = workshop_utils.plot_position_speed(position, speed, place_fields, tc_speed, neurons);
```


These neurons all show both position and speed tuning, and we see that the animal's speed and position are highly correlated. We're going to build a GLM to predict neuronal firing rate -- which variable should we use? Is the speed tuning just epiphenomenal?


## NeMoS
### Basis evaluation


- why basis?
   - without basis:
     - either the GLM says that firing rate increases exponentially as position or speed increases, which is fairly nonsensical,
     - or we have to fit the weight separately for each position or speed, which is really high-dim
   - so, basis allows us to reduce dimensionality, capture non-linear modulation of firing rate (in this case, tuning)
- why eval?
    - basis objects have two modes:
    - conv, like we've seen, for capturing time-dependent effects
    - eval, for capturing non-linear modulation / tuning
- why MSpline?
    - when deciding on eval basis, look at the tuning you want to capture, compare to the kernels: you want your tuning to be capturable by a linear combination of these
    - in cases like this, many possible basis objects we could use here and what I'll show you in a bit will allow you to determine which to use in principled manner
    - MSpline, BSpline, RaisedCosineLinear : all would let you capture this
    - weird choices:
        - cyclic bspline, except maybe for position? if end and start are the same
        - RaisedCosineLog (don't want the stretching)
        - orthogonalized exponential (specialized for...)
        - identity / history (too basic)



- Create a separate basis object for each model input.
- Visualize the basis objects.

```{code-cell} ipython3
position_basis = nmo.basis.MSplineEval(n_basis_funcs=10)
speed_basis = nmo.basis.MSplineEval(n_basis_funcs=15)
workshop_utils.plot_pos_speed_bases(position_basis, speed_basis)
```


- Combine the two basis objects into a single "additive basis"

```{code-cell} ipython3
# equivalent to calling nmo.basis.AdditiveBasis(position_basis, speed_basis)
basis = position_basis + speed_basis
```


- Create the design matrix!
- Notice that, since we passed the basis pynapple objects, we got one back, preserving the time stamps.
- `X` has the same number of time points as our input position and speed, but 25 columns. The columns come from  `n_basis_funcs` from each basis (10 for position, 15 for speed).


```{code-cell} ipython3
X = basis.compute_features(position, speed)
X
```
### Model learning


- Initialize `PopulationGLM`
- Use the "LBFGS" solver and pass `{"tol": 1e-12}` to `solver_kwargs`.
- Fit the data, passing the design matrix and spike counts to the glm object.


```{code-cell} ipython3
glm = nmo.glm.PopulationGLM(
    solver_kwargs={"tol": 1e-12},
    solver_name="LBFGS",
)

glm.fit(X, count)
```
### Prediction


- Use `predict` to check whether our GLM has captured each neuron's speed and position tuning.
- Remember to convert the predicted firing rate to spikes per second!


```{code-cell} ipython3
# predict the model's firing rate
predicted_rate = glm.predict(X) / bin_size

# same shape as the counts we were trying to predict
print(predicted_rate.shape, count.shape)

# compute the position and speed tuning curves using the predicted firing rate.
glm_pos = nap.compute_1d_tuning_curves_continuous(predicted_rate, position, 50, position.time_support)
glm_speed = nap.compute_1d_tuning_curves_continuous(predicted_rate, speed, 30, speed.time_support)
```


- Compare model and data tuning curves together. The model did a pretty good job!


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

workshop_utils.plot_position_speed_tuning(place_fields, tc_speed, glm_pos, glm_speed);
```


We can see that this model does a good job capturing both the position and the speed. In the rest of this notebook, we're going to investigate all the scientific decisions that we swept under the rug: should we regularize the model? what basis should we use? do we need both inputs?

To make our lives easier, let's create a helper function that wraps the above
lines, because we're going to be visualizing our model predictions a lot.


```{code-cell} ipython3
def visualize_model_predictions(glm, X):
    # predict the model's firing rate
    predicted_rate = glm.predict(X) / bin_size

    # compute the position and speed tuning curves using the predicted firing rate.
    glm_pos = nap.compute_1d_tuning_curves_continuous(predicted_rate, position, 50, position.time_support)
    glm_speed = nap.compute_1d_tuning_curves_continuous(predicted_rate, speed, 30, position.time_support)

    workshop_utils.plot_position_speed_tuning(place_fields, tc_speed, glm_pos, glm_speed);
```
## Scikit-learn
### How to know when to regularize?


- How do we decide when to use regularization?
- Cross-validation allows you to fairly compare different models on the same dataset.
- NeMoS makes use of [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), the standard machine learning library in python.
- Define [parameter grid](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html#grid-search) to search over.
- Anything not specified in grid will be kept constant.


```{code-cell} ipython3
param_grid = {
    "regularizer": ["UnRegularized", "Ridge"],
}
```


- Initialize scikit-learn's [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) object.

```{code-cell} ipython3
cv = model_selection.GridSearchCV(glm, param_grid, cv=cv_folds)
cv
```


- We interact with this in a very similar way to the glm object.
- In particular, call `fit` with same arguments:

```{code-cell} ipython3
cv.fit(X, count)
```


- We got a warning because we didn't specify the regularizer strength, so we just fell back on default value.
- Let's investigate results:

```{code-cell} ipython3
cv.cv_results_
```
<div class="render-all">

:::{note}
You could (and generally, should!) investigate `regularizer_strength`, but we're skipping for simplicity. To do this properly, use a slightly different syntax for `param_grid` (list of dictionaries, instead of single dictionary)

```python
param_grid = [
    {"regularizer": [nmo.regularizer.UnRegularized()]},
    {"regularizer": [nmo.regularizer.Ridge()],
     "regularizer_strength": [1e-6, 1e-3, 1]}
]
```
:::

</div>
### Select basis


- You can (and should) do something similar to determine how many basis functions you need for each input.
- NeMoS basis objects are not scikit-learn-compatible right out of the box.
- But we have provided a simple method to make them so:


```{code-cell} ipython3
position_basis = nmo.basis.MSplineEval(n_basis_funcs=10).to_transformer()
# or equivalently:
position_basis = nmo.basis.TransformerBasis(nmo.basis.MSplineEval(n_basis_funcs=10))
```


- This gives the basis object the `transform` method, which is equivalent to `compute_features`.
- However, transformers have some limits:


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [raises-exception]

position_basis.transform(position)
```


- Transformers only accept 2d inputs, whereas nemos basis objects can accept inputs of any dimensionality.
- In order to tell nemos how to reshape the 2d matrix that is the input of `transform` to whatever the basis accepts, you need to call `set_input_shape`:


```{code-cell} ipython3
# can accept array
position_basis.set_input_shape(position)
# int
position_basis.set_input_shape(1)
# tuple
position_basis.set_input_shape(position.shape[1:])
```


- Then you can call transform on the 2d input as expected.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# input needs to be 2d, so use expand_dims
position_basis.transform(np.expand_dims(position, 1))
```


- You can, equivalently, call `compute_features` *before* turning the basis into a transformer. Then we cache the shape for future use:


```{code-cell} ipython3
position_basis = nmo.basis.MSplineEval(n_basis_funcs=10)
position_basis.compute_features(position)
position_basis = position_basis.to_transformer()
speed_basis = nmo.basis.MSplineEval(n_basis_funcs=15).to_transformer().set_input_shape(1)
basis = position_basis + speed_basis
```


- Create a single TsdFrame to hold all our inputs:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

transformer_input = nap.TsdFrame(
    t=position.t,
    d=np.stack([position.d, speed.d], 1),
    time_support=position.time_support,
    columns=["position", "speed"],
)
```


- Pass this input to our transformed additive basis:

```{code-cell} ipython3
basis.transform(transformer_input)
```
### Pipelines


- If we want to cross-validate over the basis, we need more one more step: combining the basis and the GLM into a single scikit-learn estimator.
- [Pipelines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) to the rescue!


```{code-cell} ipython3
pipe = pipeline.Pipeline([
    ("basis", basis),
    ("glm", glm)
])
pipe
```


- Pipeline runs `basis.transform`, then passes that output to `glm`, so we can do everything in a single line:

```{code-cell} ipython3
pipe.fit(transformer_input, count)
```


- Visualize model predictions!


```{code-cell} ipython3
visualize_model_predictions(pipe, transformer_input)
```
### Cross-validating on the basis


Now that we have our pipeline estimator, we can cross-validate on any of its parameters!


```{code-cell} ipython3
pipe.steps
```


Let's cross-validate on:
- The number of the basis functions of the position basis
- The functional form of the basis for speed

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(pipe["basis"].basis1.n_basis_funcs)
print(pipe["basis"].basis2)
```


- Construct `param_grid`, using `__` to stand in for `.`

```{code-cell} ipython3
param_grid = {
    "basis__basis1__n_basis_funcs": [5, 10, 20],
    "basis__basis2": [nmo.basis.MSplineEval(15).set_input_shape(1),
                      nmo.basis.BSplineEval(15).set_input_shape(1),
                      nmo.basis.RaisedCosineLinearEval(15).set_input_shape(1)],
}
```


- Cross-validate as before:

```{code-cell} ipython3
cv = model_selection.GridSearchCV(pipe, param_grid, cv=cv_folds)
cv.fit(transformer_input, count)
```


- Investigate results:

```{code-cell} ipython3
cv.cv_results_
```


- These results are more complicated, so let's use [pandas dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) to make them a bit more understandable:

```{code-cell} ipython3
cv_df = pd.DataFrame(cv.cv_results_)
cv_df
# helper function for visualization
workshop_utils.plot_heatmap_cv_results(cv_df)
```


- Can easily grab the best estimator, the pipeline that did the best:

```{code-cell} ipython3
best_estim = cv.best_estimator_
best_estim
```


- Visualize model predictions!


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]
visualize_model_predictions(best_estim, transformer_input)
```
### Feature selection


- Now one more thing we can do with scikit-learn!
- Each `PopulationGLM` object has a feature mask, which allows us to exclude certain parts of the input
- Feature mask shape: `X.shape[1]` (number of columns in the design matrix) by `n_neurons` (number of neurons we're trying to predict)
- (By default, everything is included.)

```{code-cell} ipython3
pipe['glm'].feature_mask
print(pipe['glm'].feature_mask.shape)
```
```{code-cell} ipython3
workshop_utils.plot_feature_mask(pipe["glm"].feature_mask);
```

- We could manually edit feature mask, but have some helper functions -- these are currently being developed, so any feedback is appreciated!
- By default, we include all features:


```{code-cell} ipython3
m = workshop_utils.create_feature_mask(pipe["basis"], n_neurons=count.shape[1])
workshop_utils.plot_feature_mask(m);
```


- Make use of our additive basis to figure out the structure in the input
- Can selectively remove some of the features:

```{code-cell} ipython3
m = workshop_utils.create_feature_mask(pipe["basis"], ["all", "none"], n_neurons=count.shape[1])
fig=workshop_utils.plot_feature_mask(m);
```


- Can construct a set of feature masks that includes / excludes each of the sets of inputs:

```{code-cell} ipython3
feature_masks = [
    workshop_utils.create_feature_mask(basis, "all", n_neurons=count.shape[1]),
    workshop_utils.create_feature_mask(basis, ["all", "none"], n_neurons=count.shape[1]),
    workshop_utils.create_feature_mask(basis, ["none", "all"], n_neurons=count.shape[1]),
]

workshop_utils.plot_feature_mask(feature_masks, ["All", "Position", "Speed"]);
```


- One more wrinkle: the shape of this feature mask depends on the number of basis functions!
- Thus, must create a new feature mask for each possible arrangement:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

param_grid = workshop_utils.create_feature_mask_paramgrid(basis, [5, 10, 20], 
                                                          [8, 16, 32], count.shape[1])
```


- Initialize and fit GridSearchCV

```{code-cell} ipython3
cv = model_selection.GridSearchCV(best_estim, param_grid, cv=cv_folds)
cv.fit(transformer_input, count)
```


- Investigate results using pandas

```{code-cell} ipython3
cv_df = pd.DataFrame(cv.cv_results_)
cv_df
```


- For our own sanity, let's create an easier-to-read label:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# create a custom label to make the results easier to parse
def label_feature_mask(x):
    mask = x.param_glm__feature_mask
    if mask.sum() / np.prod(mask.shape) == 1:
        return "all"
    elif mask[0,0] == 1:
        return "position"
    else:
        return "speed"

cv_df['feature_mask_label'] = cv_df.apply(label_feature_mask, 1)
```


- And visualize:

```{code-cell} ipython3
workshop_utils.plot_heatmap_cv_results(cv_df, "feature_mask_label", columns="param_basis__basis2__n_basis_funcs")
```


From the above plots, we can see that:
- Position matters more than speed.
- Number of basis functions for speed doesn't matter much.
- We don't need many basis functions to represent the position.




- Visualize model predictions!


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]
visualize_model_predictions(cv.best_estimator_, transformer_input)
```
