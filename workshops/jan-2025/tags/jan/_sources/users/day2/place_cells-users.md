```
## Pynapple

- Load the data using pynapple.
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

path = workshop_utils.fetch_data("Achilles_10252013_EEG.nwb")
data = nap.load_file(path)
data
```

- Extract the spike times and mouse position.
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

spikes = data["units"]
position = data["position"]
```


- Restrict data to when animal was traversing the linear track.
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

position = position.restrict(data["forward_ep"])
spikes = spikes.restrict(data["forward_ep"])
```


- Restrict neurons to only excitatory neurons, discarding neurons with a low-firing rate.
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

spikes = spikes.getby_category("cell_type")["pE"]
spikes = spikes.getby_threshold("rate", 0.3)
```
### Place fields


- Visualize the *place fields*: neuronal firing rate as a function of position.
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

place_fields = nap.compute_1d_tuning_curves(spikes, position, 50, position.time_support)
workshop_utils.plot_place_fields(place_fields)
```


- For speed, we're only going to investigate the three neurons highlighted above.
- Bin spikes to counts at 100 Hz.
- Interpolate position to match spike resolution.
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

neurons = [82, 92, 220]
place_fields = place_fields[neurons]
spikes = spikes[neurons]
bin_size = .01
count = spikes.count(bin_size, ep=position.time_support)
position = position.interpolate(count, ep=count.time_support)
print(count.shape)
print(position.shape)
```
### Speed modulation


- Compute animal's speed for each epoch.
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

speed = []
# Analyzing each epoch separately avoids edge effects.
for s, e in position.time_support.values: 
    pos_ep = position.get(s, e)
    # Absolute difference of two consecutive points
    speed_ep = np.abs(np.diff(pos_ep)) 
    # Padding the edge so that the size is the same as the position/spike counts
    speed_ep = np.pad(speed_ep, [0, 1], mode="edge") 
    # Converting to cm/s 
    speed_ep = speed_ep * position.rate
    speed.append(speed_ep)

speed = nap.Tsd(t=position.t, d=np.hstack(speed), time_support=position.time_support)
print(speed.shape)
```


- Compute the tuning curve with pynapple's [`compute_1d_tuning_curves`](https://pynapple.org/generated/pynapple.process.tuning_curves.html#pynapple.process.tuning_curves.compute_1d_tuning_curves)
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell, skip-execution]
# compute tuning curve here
tc_speed = 
```


- Visualize the position and speed tuning for these neurons.
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

fig = workshop_utils.plot_position_speed(position, speed, place_fields, tc_speed, neurons);
```


These neurons all show both position and speed tuning, and we see that the animal's speed and position are highly correlated. We're going to build a GLM to predict neuronal firing rate -- which variable should we use? Is the speed tuning just epiphenomenal?
## NeMoS
### Basis evaluation


- Create a separate basis object for each model input.
- Visualize the basis objects.
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Combine the two basis objects into a single "additive basis"
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Create the design matrix!
- Notice that, since we passed the basis pynapple objects, we got one back, preserving the time stamps.
- `X` has the same number of time points as our input position and speed, but 25 columns. The columns come from  `n_basis_funcs` from each basis (10 for position, 15 for speed).
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```

### Model learning


- Initialize `PopulationGLM`
- Use the "LBFGS" solver and pass `{"tol": 1e-12}` to `solver_kwargs`.
- Fit the data, passing the design matrix and spike counts to the glm object.


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [skip-execution]

# initialize 
glm =

# and fit
```
### Prediction


- Use `predict` to check whether our GLM has captured each neuron's speed and position tuning.
- Remember to convert the predicted firing rate to spikes per second!


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [skip-execution]

# predict the model's firing rate
predicted_rate = 

# same shape as the counts we were trying to predict
print(predicted_rate.shape, count.shape)

# compute the position and speed tuning curves using the predicted firing rate.
glm_pos = 
glm_speed = 
```


- Compare model and data tuning curves together. The model did a pretty good job!
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

workshop_utils.plot_position_speed_tuning(place_fields, tc_speed, glm_pos, glm_speed);
```


We can see that this model does a good job capturing both the position and the speed. In the rest of this notebook, we're going to investigate all the scientific decisions that we swept under the rug: should we regularize the model? what basis should we use? do we need both inputs?

To make our lives easier, let's create a helper function that wraps the above
lines, because we're going to be visualizing our model predictions a lot.
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```

## Scikit-learn
### How to know when to regularize?


- How do we decide when to use regularization?
- Cross-validation allows you to fairly compare different models on the same dataset.
- NeMoS makes use of [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), the standard machine learning library in python.
- Define [parameter grid](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html#grid-search) to search over.
- Anything not specified in grid will be kept constant.
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Initialize scikit-learn's [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) object.
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- We interact with this in a very similar way to the glm object.
- In particular, call `fit` with same arguments:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- We got a warning because we didn't specify the regularizer strength, so we just fell back on default value.
- Let's investigate results:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



:::{note}
You could (and generally, should!) investigate `regularizer_strength`, but we're skipping for simplicity. To do this properly, use a slightly different syntax for `param_grid` (list of dictionaries, instead of single dictionary)

```python
param_grid = [
    {"regularizer": [nmo.regularizer.UnRegularized()]},
    {"regularizer": [nmo.regularizer.Ridge()],
     "regularizer_strength": [1e-6, 1e-3, 1]}
]
```
:::
### Select basis


- You can (and should) do something similar to determine how many basis functions you need for each input.
- NeMoS basis objects are not scikit-learn-compatible right out of the box.
- But we have provided a simple method to make them so:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- This gives the basis object the `transform` method, which is equivalent to `compute_features`.
- However, transformers have some limits:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Transformers only accept 2d inputs, whereas nemos basis objects can accept inputs of any dimensionality.
- In order to tell nemos how to reshape the 2d matrix that is the input of `transform` to whatever the basis accepts, you need to call `set_input_shape`:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Then you can call transform on the 2d input as expected.
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- You can, equivalently, call `compute_features` *before* turning the basis into a transformer. Then we cache the shape for future use:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Create a single TsdFrame to hold all our inputs:
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

transformer_input = nap.TsdFrame(
    t=position.t,
    d=np.stack([position.d, speed.d], 1),
    time_support=position.time_support,
    columns=["position", "speed"],
)
```


- Pass this input to our transformed additive basis:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```

### Pipelines


- If we want to cross-validate over the basis, we need more one more step: combining the basis and the GLM into a single scikit-learn estimator.
- [Pipelines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) to the rescue!
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Pipeline runs `basis.transform`, then passes that output to `glm`, so we can do everything in a single line:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Visualize model predictions!
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```

### Cross-validating on the basis


Now that we have our pipeline estimator, we can cross-validate on any of its parameters!
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



Let's cross-validate on:
- The number of the basis functions of the position basis
- The functional form of the basis for speed
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Construct `param_grid`, using `__` to stand in for `.`
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Cross-validate as before:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Investigate results:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- These results are more complicated, so let's use [pandas dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) to make them a bit more understandable:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Can easily grab the best estimator, the pipeline that did the best:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Visualize model predictions!
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]
visualize_model_predictions(best_estim, transformer_input)
```
### Feature selection


- Now one more thing we can do with scikit-learn!
- Each `PopulationGLM` object has a feature mask, which allows us to exclude certain parts of the input
- Feature mask shape: `X.shape[1]` (number of columns in the design matrix) by `n_neurons` (number of neurons we're trying to predict)
- (By default, everything is included.)
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```


- We could manually edit feature mask, but have some helper functions -- these are currently being developed, so any feedback is appreciated!
- By default, we include all features:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Make use of our additive basis to figure out the structure in the input
- Can selectively remove some of the features:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Can construct a set of feature masks that includes / excludes each of the sets of inputs:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- One more wrinkle: the shape of this feature mask depends on the number of basis functions!
- Thus, must create a new feature mask for each possible arrangement:
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

param_grid = workshop_utils.create_feature_mask_paramgrid(basis, [5, 10, 20], 
                                                          [8, 16, 32], count.shape[1])
```


- Initialize and fit GridSearchCV
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- Investigate results using pandas
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- For our own sanity, let's create an easier-to-read label:
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# create a custom label to make the results easier to parse
def label_feature_mask(x):
    mask = x.param_glm__feature_mask
    if mask.sum() / np.prod(mask.shape) == 1:
        return "all"
    elif mask[0,0] == 1:
        return "position"
    else:
        return "speed"

cv_df['feature_mask_label'] = cv_df.apply(label_feature_mask, 1)
```


- And visualize:
```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



- What do we see?


- Visualize model predictions!
```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]
visualize_model_predictions(cv.best_estimator_, transformer_input)
```
