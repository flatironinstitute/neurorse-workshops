Construct a design matrix with a single predictor, using a basis of your choice, then construct, fit, and score your model to a single neuron (remembering to either use your train/test or cross-validation to avoid overfitting). Then add regularization to your GLM. Then return to the beginning and add more predictors. Then fit all the neurons. Then evaluate what basis functions and parameters are best for your predictors. Then use the tricks we covered in [the advanced nemos notebook](sklearn-feature-selection) to evaluate whether which predictors are necessary for your model, which are the most important.\n",
