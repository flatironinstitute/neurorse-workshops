Construct a design matrix with a single predictor, using a basis of your choice, then construct, fit, and score your model to a single neuron (remembering to either use your train/test or cross-validation to avoid overfitting). Then add regularization to your GLM. Then return to the beginning and add more predictors. Then fit all the neurons. Then evaluate what basis functions and parameters are best for your predictors.

Recall in the [current injection (search for \"Visualize the current history model's learned filter\")](visualize-filter-full) and [head direction (search for \"We can plot the resluting response,\")](head-direction-basis-users) notebooks; we can multiply these coefficients by the basis functions to create the filter for visualization. This can be done using [numpy.matmul](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html) or [numpy.einsum](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html).\n",

You can then use either [numpy.matmul](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html) or [numpy.einsum](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html) to multiply the weights by the functions, computing the filter.\n",
