# Intro to Jupyter Lab

If you are unfamiliar with jupyter lab, please come to our "Intro to Jupyter Lab" session in the Omni San Diego Hotel, Gallery 1, at 4:30pm on Wednesday, November 12.

This introduction will go over some of the more common shortcuts we will use during the live-coding sessions of the workshop. We will attempt to explain everything as we do it, but this introduction will hopefully start familiarizing you with the shortcuts so you can feel more confident.

Together we will open up a new jupyter notebook and practice:
- Toggling between jupyter's command and edit mode (`Escape`, `Enter`).
- Navigating up and down the notebook (arrow keys).
- Creating a new cell above (`a`) and below (`b`) the current one.
- Running code cells, either keeping focus on the current cell (`Ctrl + Enter`) or advancing it to the next cell (`Shift + Enter`).
- Pulling up function docstrings (`Shift + Tab`).
- Copying (`c`) and pasting (`v`) cells.
- Ipython "magic" functions:
    - Display all currently-defined variables (`%whos`).
    - Automatically reload imported files (`%load_ext autoreload; %autoreload 2`)
