# Cheatsheet and reference


During this workshop, {download}`this cheatsheet PDF <_static/SFN_2025_workshop_cheatsheet.pdf>` may be a helpful reference. (We will also have printed copies available.)

Additionally, if you would like to read through a brief introduction, both [pynapple](https://pynapple.org/user_guide/01_introduction_to_pynapple.html) and [nemos](https://nemos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) have such pages on their documentation.

Finally, while working on the group projects, it may also be useful to check out the packages' API reference: [pynapple](https://pynapple.org/api.html), [nemos](https://nemos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html).
