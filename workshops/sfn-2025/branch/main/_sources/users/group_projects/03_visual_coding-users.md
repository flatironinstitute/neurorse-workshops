# Exploring the Visual Coding Dataset
This notebook has had all its explanatory text removed and has not been run.
 It is intended to be downloaded and run locally (or on the provided binder)
 while listening to the presenter's explanation. In order to see the fully
 rendered of this notebook, go [here](../../full/group_projects/03_visual_coding.md)


This notebook serves as a group project: in groups of 4 or 5, you will analyze data from the [Visual Coding - Neuropixels dataset](https://portal.brain-map.org/circuits-behavior/visual-coding-neuropixels), published by the Allen Institute. This dataset uses [extracellular electrophysiology probes](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24636) to record spikes from multiple regions in the brain during passive visual stimulation.

To start, we will focus on the activity of neurons in the visual cortex (VISp) during passive exposure to full-field flashes of color either black (coded as "-1.0") or white (coded as "1.0") in a gray background. If you have time, you can apply the same procedure to other stimuli or brain areas.

In this notebook, the pre-filled section will first select visually responsive neurons in area VISp. Then, you will fit GLMs to the selected neurons using `nemos`.

As this is the last notebook, the instructions are a bit more hands-off: you will make more of the modeling decisions yourselves. As a group, you will use your neuroscience knowledge and the skills gained over this workshop to decide:
- How to avoid overfitting.
- What features to include in your GLMs.
- Which basis functions (and parameters) to use for each feature.
- How to regularize your features.
- How to evaluate your model.

At the end of this session, we will regroup to discuss the decisions people made and evaluate each others' models.

## Downloading and preparing data

In this section, we will download the data and extract the relevant parts for analysis and modeling. This section is largely presented to you as is, so that you can get to the substantive sections more quickly.

First we download and load the data into pynapple.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

data = workshop_utils.fetch_data("visual_coding_data.zip")
flashes, units = [nap.load_file(d) for d in data]
```


Now that we have our spiking data, let's restrict our dataset to the relevant part.

![Visual stimuli set](../../_static/visual_stimuli_set.png)

During the flashes presentation trials, mice were exposed to white or black full-field flashes in a gray background, each lasting 250 ms, and separated by a 2 second inter-trial interval. In total, they were exposed to 150 flashes (75 black, 75 white).


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# create a separate object for black and white flashes
flashes_white = flashes[flashes["color"] == "1.0"]
flashes_black = flashes[flashes["color"] == "-1.0"]
```


Let's visualize our stimuli:


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all, hide-input]

n_flashes = 5
n_seconds = 13
offset = .5

start = flashes["start"].min() - offset
end = start + n_seconds

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (17, 4))
for flash, c in zip([flashes_white, flashes_black], ["silver", "black"]):
    for fl in flash[:n_flashes]:
        ax.axvspan(fl.start[0], fl.end[0], color=c, alpha=.4, ec=c)      

plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Absent = 0, Present = 1")
ax.set_title("Stimuli presentation")
ax.yaxis.set_major_locator(MaxNLocator(integer=True))

plt.xlim(start-.1,end)
    
```
## Preliminary analyses and neuron selection


In this section, we will select a subset of the neurons that are visually responsive, which we will fit our GLM to.

First, we'll construct a {class}`~pynapple.IntervalSet` called `extended_flashes` which contains the peristimulus time. Right now, our `flashes` `IntervalSet` defines the start and end time for the flashes. In order to make sure we can model the pre-stimulus baseline and any responses to the stimulus being turned off, we would like to expand these intervals to go from 500 msecs before the start of the stimuli to 500 msecs after the end.

This `IntervalSet` will be the same shape as `flashes` and have the same metadata columns.


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

dt = .50 # 500 ms
start = flashes.start - dt # Start 500 ms before stimulus presentation
end = flashes.end + dt # End 500 ms after stimulus presentation

extended_flashes = nap.IntervalSet(start, end, metadata=flashes.metadata) 
```


Now, we'll create two separate `IntervalSet` objects, `extended_flashes_black` and `extended_flashes_white`, which contain this info for only the black and the white flashes, respectively.


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

extended_flashes_white = extended_flashes[extended_flashes["color"] == "1.0"]
extended_flashes_black = extended_flashes[extended_flashes["color"] == "-1.0"]
```


Now, we'll select our neurons. There are four criteria we want to use:

1. Brain area: we are interested in analyzing VISp units for this tutorial
2. Quality: we will only select “good” quality units. If you're curious, you can (optionally) [read more](https://alleninstitute.github.io/openscope_databook/visualization/visualize_unit_metrics.html) how about the Allen Institute defines quality.
3. Firing rate: overall, we want units with a firing rate larger than 2Hz around the presentation of stimuli
4. Responsiveness: we want units that actually respond to changes in the visual stimuli, i.e., their firing rate changes as a result of the stimulus.

We'll create a new `TsGroup`, `selected_units`, which includes only those units that meet the first three criteria, then check that it passes the assertion block.


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# Filter units according criteria 1 & 2
selected_units = units[(units["brain_area"]=="VISp") & (units["quality"]=="good")] 

# Restrict around stimuli presentation
selected_units = selected_units.restrict(extended_flashes) 

# Filter according to criterion 3
selected_units = selected_units[(selected_units["rate"]>2.0)]
```


Now, in order to determine the responsiveness of the units, it's helpful to use the {func}`~pynapple.process.perievent.compute_perievent` function: this will align units' spiking timestamps with the onset of the stimulus repetitions and take an average over them.

Let's use that function to construct two separate perievent dictionaries, one aligned to the start of the white stimuli, one aligned to the start of the black, and they should run from 250 msec before to 500 msec after the event.


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# Set window of perievent 500 ms before and after the start of the event
window_size = (-.250, .500) 

peri_white = nap.compute_perievent(timestamps=selected_units,
                                   tref=nap.Ts(flashes_white.start),
                                   minmax=window_size)
peri_black = nap.compute_perievent(timestamps=selected_units,
                                   tref=nap.Ts(flashes_black.start),
                                   minmax=window_size)
```


Visualizing these perievents can help us determine what features we'll want to include in our GLM. The following helper function should help.


```{code-cell} ipython3

plot_raster_psth(peri_black, selected_units, "black", n_units=9, start_unit=0)
```


You could manually visualize each of our units and select those that appear, from their PSTH to be responsive.

However, it would be easier to scale (and more reproducible) if you came up with some measure of responsiveness. So how do we compute something that captures "this neuron responds to visual stimuli"? Here, we will define "responsiveness" as the normalized difference in average firing rate between during stimulus presentation and before the stimulus was presented. We'll define a function that does that in the following hidden cell.

If you have other ideas and the time to explore them, you can return to this section and try other definitions of responsiveness.


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all, hide-input]

def get_responsiveness(perievents, bin_size=0.005):
    """Calculate responsiveness for each neuron. This is computed as:

        Average firing rate prior (250 ms) to the presentation of stimulus
        across all instances prior of stimulus.

        # Count the number of timestamps in each bin_size bin.
        peri_counts = peri.count(bin_size)

# Only keep units that are within the 15% most responsive for either black or white

```


Let's visualize the selected units PSTHs to make sure they all look reasonable:


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

print(f"Remaining units: {len(selected_units)}")
peri_white = {k: peri_white[k] for k in selected_units.index}

plot_raster_psth(peri_black, selected_units, "black", n_units=len(peri_black))
plot_raster_psth(peri_white, selected_units, "white", n_units=len(peri_white))
```
## Avoiding overfitting


As we've seen throughout this workshop, it is important to avoid overfitting your model. We've covered two strategies for doing so: either separate your dataset into train and test subsets or set up a cross-validation scheme. Pick one of these approaches and use it when fitting your GLM model in the next section.

You might find it helpful to refer back to the [advanced nemos](sklearn-cv) notebook and / or to use the following pynapple functions: {func}`~pynapple.IntervalSet.set_diff`, {func}`~pynapple.IntervalSet.union`, {func}`~pynapple.TsGroup.restrict` (see [phase precession notebook](phase-precess-cv)).

:::{admonition} Hints
:class: hint

Throughout this section and the next we'll include hints. They'll either be links back to earlier notebooks from this workshop that show an example of how to do the step in question, or a hint admonition like this, which you can expand to get a hint.

## Fit a GLM


In this section, you will use nemos to build a GLM. There are a lot of scientific decisions to be made here, so we suggest starting simple and then adding complexity. Construct a design matrix with a single predictor, using a basis of your choice, then construct, fit, and score your model to a single neuron (remembering to either use your train/test or cross-validation to avoid overfitting). Then add regularization to your GLM. Then return to the beginning and add more predictors. Then fit all the neurons. Then evaluate what basis functions and parameters are best for your predictors. Then use the tricks we covered in [the advanced nemos notebook](sklearn-feature-selection) to evaluate whether which predictors are necessary for your model, which are the most important.

You don't have to exactly follow those steps, but make sure you can go from beginning to end before getting too complex.

Good luck and we look forward to seeing what you come up with!



### Prepare data


- Create spike count data. (Hint: review the [current injection notebook](current-inj-basic).)


```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```

### Construct design matrix


- Decide on feature(s).
- Decide on basis. (Hint: review the [current injection](current-inj-basis) or [place cell](sklearn-basis) notebooks.)
- Construct design matrix. (Hint: review the [place cell](basis_eval_place_cells) notebook.)

:::{admonition} What features should I include?
:class: hint dropdown

If you're having trouble coming up with features to include, here are some possibilities:
- Stimulus. (Review the [current injection](current-inj-prep) notebook.)
- Stimulus onset. (Hint: you can use {func}`numpy.diff` to find when the stimulus transitions from off to on.)
- Stimulus offset. (Hint: you can use {func}`numpy.diff` to find when the stimulus transitions from on to off.)
- For multiple neurons: neuron-to-neuron coupling. (Refer back to the [the head direction notebook from the first day](head_direction_fit) to see an example of fitting coupling filters.)

For the stimuli predictors, you probably want to model white and black separately.

:::


```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```

### Construct and fit your model


- Decide on regularization. (Hint: review Edoardo's presentation and the [place cell](sklearn-cv) notebook.)
- Initialize GLM. (Hint: review the [current injection](current-inj-glm) or [place cell](sklearn-cv) notebooks.)
- Call fit. (Hint: review the [current injection](current-inj-glm) or [place cell](sklearn-cv) notebooks.)
- Visualize result on PSTHs. (Note that you should use {func}`~pynapple.process.perievent.compute_perievent_continuous` and the model predictions here! Otherwise, this looks very similar to our PSTH calculation above.)


```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```



Here's a helper function for plotting the PSTH of the data and predictions (for one or multiple neurons), which you may find helpful for visualizing your model performance.

The following cell shows you how to call this visualization function. Its arguments are:
- The PSTH object computed from the data. This should only contain the responses to either the black or white flashes, but can contain the PSTHs from one or more-than-one neurons.
- A string, either `"white"` or `"black"`, which determines some of the styling.
- Any number of keyword arguments (e.g., `predictions=` shown below) whose values are a tuple of `(style, peri)`, where `style` is a valid matplotlib style (e.g., `"red"`) and `peri` is additional PSTHs to plot. Expected use is, as below, to plot the predictions in a different color on top of the actual data.


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

plot_pop_psth(peri_white[unit_id], "white", predictions=("red", peri_white_pred_unit))
plot_pop_psth(peri_black[unit_id], "black", predictions=("red", peri_black_pred_unit))
```
### Score your model


- We trained on the train set, so now we score on the test set. (Or use cross-validation.)
- Get a score for your model that you can use to compare across the modeling choices outlined above. (Hint: refer back to the [current injection](current-inj-score) or [place cell](sklearn-cv) notebook.)


```{code-cell}
# enter code here
```

### Try to improve your model?


- Go back to the beginning of [this section](visual-glm) and try to improve your model's performance (as reflected by increased score).
- Keep track of what you've tried and their respective scores. 
    - You can do this by hand, but constructing a [pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html), as we've seen in the [advanced nemos notebook](sklearn-cv), is useful:


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [render-all]

# Example construction of dataframe.
# In this:
# - additive_basis is the single AdditiveBasis object we used to construct the entire design matrix
# - model is the GLM we fit to a single neuron
# - unit_id is the int identifying the neuron we're fitting
# - score is the float giving the model score, summarizing model performance (on the test set)
